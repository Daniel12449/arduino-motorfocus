# arduino-motorfocus

Simple moonlite focuser protocol implementation for Arduino and stepper motors. Temperature drift is not implemented yet.

Tested with Arduino Nano and cheap [28BYJ-48 stepper motor with driver](https://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/SmallSteppers) and [INDI / Ekos](http://indilib.org). Works also with [Pololu A4988 Stepper Motor Driver](https://www.pololu.com/product/1182) (see wiring).

Updated 3D/CAD models for TS 65/420 Quadruplet are available at Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2063325

## Wiring

### Wiring for 28BYJ-48 stepper motor with ULN2003A breakout board:

### Wiring for A4988 driver
Change Line #13 in `arduino-motorfocus.ino` from `//#define USE_DRIVER` to `#define USE_DRIVER`

### Wiring for in/out buttons
The internal pullups are active so you have to connect your buttons to GND.
